def inhomogeneous_operator(
    nodes: sim.RVector, time: float, order: int, threshold: float, tolerance: float
) -> sim.CVector:
    """
    Evaluates the function of the inhomogeneous operator on a set of given
    nodes, at a specified time point. This function represents the residual of
    the time evolution operator, minus its truncated Taylor expansion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodes: simulation.RVector
        The real valued nodes to evaluate the function of the inhomogeneous
        operator on. In general, these should be either Chebyshev-Gauss or
        Chebyshev-Lobatto nodes (Chebyshev expansion).
    time: float
        The time point at which to evaluate the function of the inhomogeneous
        operator on.
    order: int
        The order of the truncated Taylor expansion of the inhomogeneous
        operator.
    threshold: float
        The threshold above which to use the exact definition of the function
        of the inhomogeneous operator. A stable definition is used if any of
        the (nodes x time) points fall below the threshold.
    tolerance: float
        The tolerance for the stable function definition of the inhomogeneous
        operator. This is used to truncate a Taylor series when convergence is
        reached.

    Returns
    -------
    simulation.CVector
        The evaluated inhomogeneous operator function values.

    Calculates the inhomogeneous kets which represent time-evolved states with
    corrections from time derivatives of an inhomogeneous term. The derivatives
    should be calculated through converting Chebyshev expansion coefficients or
    Newtonian interpolation coefficients to Taylor-like derivative terms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operator: simulation.GMatrix
        The operator (e.g. Hamiltonian) acting on the ket.
    ket: simulation.GVector
        The ket (e.g. wavefunction) being acted upon by the operator.
    derivatives: simulation.GVectors
        The Taylor-like derivatives of an inhomogeneous term. The zeroth axis

    order: int
